        <h1> About me</h1>
        <p>A Vancouver based recent graduate, with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, as well as a bachelor's in Computer Science. I greatly enjoy design in both fields, 
          having created a number of CAD designs, as well as designing applications in a number of languages such as C++, JavaScript, and Python. I have a particular passion for front end design (including this page, and all of its assets)

        <h1> Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering 2015-2020</h1>
        <p>While studying as a mechanical engineer, I specialized in failure analyses and fluid simulations, both employing ANSYS. Practical applications of mathematics had been my specialty, with a focus on visualizing 3D space and accurate modelling of physical systems. For my Capstone, I had worked with a team to design assistive devices for tetraplegic water sports users. Throughout the degree, I have accrued both technical experience such as CAD work using Solidworks, as well as project managment experience</p>

        <h1> Bachelor of Computer Science 2020-2022</h1>
        <p>I saw an opportunity in computer science to explore a number of topics I had always been interested while studying as a mechanical engineer, such as focusing on architecture design, debugging, and optimization in coding. With a focus on advanced algorithms, and machine learning, I  have experience with the following:
          <ol>
            <li>C++ design for rendering and animation</li>
            <li>Python for intermediate and advanced machine learning</li>
            <li>JavaScript design for a backend query system, and unit testing</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS, React, and Redux for front end design</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h2>Fuel Cell Testing Engineer (January 2019 - August 2019)</h2>
              <p>Using a front end scripting language, automated the scripts for multiple test benches such that they would have a single source of control, and allowed benches to run without manual supervision for days or weeks on end. Subsequently analyzed data for performance of fuel cells</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h2>Learning Technology Designer (August 2017 - December 2017)</h2>
              <p>Designed and implemented a front end site on behalf of the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at UBC. Implemented a new system for tracking instructor hours, both past and future. The site can be found <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/oeetoolbox/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

            <li>
              <h2>Data Analyst (July 2017 - August 2017)</h2>
              <p>Summarized client usage of company's products, and identified discrepencies in reported data and actual usage time</p>

          <h1>Fastener Classification in Python</h1>
          <p>Along with a project partner and using Python, we had designed a classifier for identifying various specifications of fasteners of various sizes. Using the OpenCV library along with Tensorflow, the classifier trained on various densenets in order to identify existing classes for fasteners </p>

        <h1>Small Personal Robot (Arduino)</h1>
        <p>
          Having worked on robotic teams during my degrees, working with microcontrollers, designing for electronics is a continuing interest of mine. Depicted is a physical prototype for a small personal robot that reacts to motion and sound, and responds with noise and movement depending on how its treated by the user. This project combined parallelizing my work schedule between CAD work and programming the responses for the robot

        <h1>Animation System for Game Application in C++</h1>
        <p>Working with a small team of 6, we had designed and produced a 2D dungeon crawler rpg, with a focus on engaging combat scenarios and exploration. Working in C++, I had implemented the animation system for all of the sprites, as well as produced the various animations used as well in the form of 40 different sprite sets. I loved combining my experience in computer science with a hobby of animation/art</p>
