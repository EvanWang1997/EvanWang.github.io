        <h1> About me</h1>
        <p>A Vancouver based recent graduate, with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, as well as a bachelor's in Computer Science. I greatly enjoy design in both fields, 
          such as CAD design, as well as designing applications in a number of languages such as C++, JavaScript, and Python. I have a particular passion for front end design (including this page, and all of its assets)

        <h1> Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering 2015-2020</h1>
        <p>While studying as a mechanical engineer, I specialized in failure analyses and fluid simulations, both employing ANSYS. Practical applications of mathematics had been my specialty, with a focus on visualizing 3D space and accurate modelling of physical systems. For my Capstone, I had worked with a team to design assisstive devices for paraplegic and tetraplegic water sports. Throughout the degree, I have accrued both technical experience such as CAD work using Solidworks, as well as project managment experience</p>

        <h1> Bachelor of Computer Science 2020-2022</h1>
        <p>I saw an opportunity in computer science to explore a number of topics I had always been interested while studying as a mechanical engineer, such as focusing on architecture design, debugging, and optimization in coding. With a focus on advanced algorithms, and machine learning in Python througout the degree, I also have experience with the following:
          <ol>
            <li>C++ design for rendering and animation</li>
            <li>JavaScript design for a backend query system</li>
            <li>HTML, CSS, React and Redux for front end design</li>
            <li>Logical programming in Prolog</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
